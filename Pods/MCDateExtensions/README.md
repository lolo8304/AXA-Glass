# MCDateExtensions - Having fun with NSDate.

```objective-c
#import "NSDate+MCExtensions.h"

- (void)funWithMCDateExtensions
{
  NSDate* today = [NSDate date];

  // Today? Tomorrow? Yesterday?
  [today isToday]; // returns YES
  [today isYesterday]; // returns NO
  [today isTomorrow]; // returns NO

  // Compare based on day
  [today isSameDayAsDate:[NSDate date]]; // Most likely returns YES

  // Get all the details of a date
  NSDateComponents* todayBrokenDown = [today components];
  // ...with specific units
  NSDateComponents* specificUnits = [today componentsWithUnits:(NSYearCalendarUnit | NSMonthCalendarUnit | NSDayCalendarUnit)];

  // Some fun Maths!
  NSDate* sameDayNextYear = [today dateByAddingYears:1];
  NSDate* sameDayNextQuarter = [today dateByAddingQuarters:1];
  NSDate* sameDayInTwoMonth = [today dateByAddingMonths:2];
  NSDate* sameDayNextWeek = [today dateByAddingWeeks:1];
  NSDate* yesterday = [today dateByAddingDays:-1];
  NSDate* tomorrow = [today dateByAddingHours:24];
  NSDate* nextHour = [today dateByAddingMinutes:60];
  NSDate* inTwoMinutes = [today dateByAddingSeconds:120];
  NSDate* inAFewSeconds = [today dateByAddingCalendarUnit:(NSSecondCalendarUnit) value:30];

  // Differences
  NSInteger days = [NSDate daysBetweenDate:today andDate:tomorrow]; // returns 1
  NSInteger weeks = [NSDate daysBetweenDate:today andDate:sameDayNextWeek]; // returns 1
  NSInteger months = [NSDate monthsBetweenDate:today andDate:sameDayInTwoMonth]; // returns 2
  NSInteger years = [NSDate monthsBetweenDate:today andDate:sameDayNextYear]; // returns 1
